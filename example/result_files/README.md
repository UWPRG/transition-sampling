# Result Files from Aimless Shooting

These are the files generated by 4 parallel aimless shootings. Each file pair
`result{i}.xyz/result{i}.csv` represents an individual one of those aimless shootings.
The results of all parallel shootings are collected into one `result.xyz/result.csv`, 
which is typically what's used for the CV calculation. See 
[the above readme](../README.md) for more info about the results format.
