# Result Files from Aimless Shooting

These are the files generated by 4 parallel aimless shootings. Each file pair
`result{i}.xyz/result{i}.csv` represents an individual one of those aimless shootings.
The results of all parallel shootings are collected into one `result.xyz/result.csv`, 
which is typically what's used for the CV calculation. See 
[the above readme](../README.md) for more info about the results format.

If any of these file names already exist, they are appended to rather than overwritten.
This allows rerunning for more points and writing to the same files.

Note that these shootings were killed early, which is why each individual does not have
5 accepted shooting points, as it usually would.
