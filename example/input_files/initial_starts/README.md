# Initial Starts

This directory contains `xyz` files that will be tried to use as initial aimless shooting
points. Each will be attempted `n_vel_tries` before deciding that are not a good initial 
start. If none are accepted, the aimless shooting fails because it cannot start.

There is no requirement for file names, just that they end in `.xyz`.
