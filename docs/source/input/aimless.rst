``md_inputs`` (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are the required inputs for running aimless shooting and generating new shooting points with MD. If this section
is excluded, MD will not be run and we will continue to the next present part.

``engine_inputs``
    ``engine`` : `str` (Required)
        Define what MD engine will be used. Currently only ``cp2k`` and ``gromacs``

    ``engine_dir`` : `str` (Required)
        Directory where temporary files created by engine (e.g. md.out) will be placed. If running over multiple nodes,
        all nodes must be able to access this (i.e. ``/tmp/*`` may not work). Files here will not be deleted, so they
        can be inspected afterwards if anything went wrong.

        .. note:: This should be the full path.

    ``md_cmd`` : `str` (Required)
        Command to launch one simulation with, excluding any specific input or output files

    ``plumed_file`` : `str` (Required)
        Path to the PLUMED file containing COMMITTOR basins

    ``delta_t`` : `float` (Required)
        The :math:`\Delta t` as defined in aimless shooting, in femtoseconds.

    **Other required engine specific inputs: see** :doc:`../engines/engines`

``aimless_inputs``

    ``starts_dir`` : `str` (Required)
        Path to directory containing ``.xyz`` files (in Ã…) of initial starting guesses

    ``output_name`` : `str` (Required)
        Prefix to the output names. Two files will be created, ``<output_name>.xyz`` and ``<output_name>``.csv.
        Note that this string should not include an extension.

    ``temp`` : `float` (Required)
        Temperature to generate initial velocities at in Kelvin

    ``n_parallel`` : `int` (Required)
        Number of aimless shootings to run in parallel. Total number of simulations
        running at any given point is given by ``n_parallel * 2``

    ``n_points`` : `int` (Required)
        Number of accepted shooting points to be generated by a single aimless shooting before considered "done"

    ``n_state_tries`` : `int` (Required)
        Number of times to reselect a known accepting state on failure to accept

    ``n_vel_tries`` : `int` (Required)
        Number of times to resample velocities after getting a rejected shooting point
        before retrying known accepting states

    ``acceptor`` (Optional - can be defined, excluded, or null. In the latter two cases, uses ``default``)
        Used to define what cases of committing should be considered accepted.

        ``type`` : `str` (``default`` or ``multibasin``)
            * If ``default``, accept if the forward and reverse trajectories commit to any different basins

            * If ``multibasin``, accept if the forward and reverse trajectories commit to a product basin and a
              reactant basin, which must be defined as lists below.

        ``reactants`` : `list[int]` (Required if ``type = multibasin``)
            The basins to be considered as "reactants"

        ``products`` : `list[int]` (Required if ``type = multibasin``)
            The basins to be considered as "products"
